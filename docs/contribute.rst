Contribute
==========

This is a tutorial on how to contribute to the package.


Why GitHub?
-----------

By using GitHub *Pull requests* collaboration on developing the package
is nicely structured and allows an easy review of new code by multiple
people to spot bugs, problems and compatibility issues. 

The *Issues* tab on GitHub can serve as a place for suggestions and 
discussions about already implemented code.


How to contribute
-----------------

1. The agepy repository is protected, which means that you can't push
   any changes to it. Therefore, create a *Fork* of the agepy 
   repository. This creates your own *copy* of the repository, which is 
   linked to the original. In order to do this click 
   **Create a new fork**

    .. image:: _static/create_fork_1.png
        :width: 800

   on the `agepy`_ GitHub page and then **Create fork**

    .. image:: _static/create_fork_2.png
        :width: 800

2. Clone the original repository to your PC::

    git clone https://github.com/exp4-age/agepy.git

3. Move into the new agepy directory and add your fork as a remote ::

    git remote add <username> https://github.com/<username>/agepy.git

   or ::

    git remote add <username> git@github.com:adryyan/agepy.git

   depending on how you set up your authentification on GitHub.
   Insert your GitHub username into <username>, so that you can 
   *push* and *pull* to / from your *Fork*.

    .. note::

        The <username> directly after ``git remote add`` is just the 
        name for the remote and you could give it a different name that
        makes sense to you. 

4. In order to test the code you write, setup a virtual python 
   environment (conda, venv, ...) and install the agepy package in 
   editable mode::

    pip install -e path/to/agepy

   Replace ``path/to/agepy`` with the path to your cloned repository.
   By doing this the package will be sourced from the code in your 
   local git repository and any changes you make will be immediately
   present, when you want to test / debug them.

    .. note::

        If you are using the *Anaconda Navigator* go to your 
        environments, choose / create an environment, click on the play
        button and select ``Open Terminal`` and run the command.

5. Once you have implemented your changes / new code, you can follow
   the usual git workflow by adding the changes ::

    git add -A

   creating a commit ::

    git commit -m "Some descriptive message"

   pulling updates from the original repository ::

    git pull origin main

   merging them if necessary and then pushing to your *Fork* with ::

    git push <username> main

6. The changes are now only on your *Fork* and not in the original
   repository yet. But now you can open a *Pull request* from your 
   forked repository by clicking on *Contribute* and then 
   *Open pull request*:

    .. image:: _static/pull_request.png
        :width: 800

   You can then write a few sentences about what you did and open
   the pull request. Everyone can then discuss the changes, suggest / 
   make corrections and finally approve the pull_request. The pull
   request will then get merged by an owner / maintainer.

8. In order to sync your fork with the now updated origin, you can 
   follow the `Syncing a fork`_ tutorial.


Style guide
-----------

When writing code for the package, the style should match that of the 
the other code in the package.

Some guidelines are listed here:

* Parameter names should be consistent between different functions where 
  it makes sense.

* Try follow the `PEP 8`_ style guide as much as possible. 

    * Maximum line length for code: 79 characters
    * Maximum line length for docstrings / comments: 72 characters
    * ...

* Provide a comment for every important line in your code.


Writing docstrings
------------------

For improved legibility, docstrings are parsed using the 
`sphinx.ext.napoleon`_ extension. This means that the docstrings can and
should be written in the same syntax used by *NumPy*::

    def func(arg1, arg2):
        """Summary line.

        Extended description of function.

        Parameters
        ----------
        arg1 : int
            Description of arg1
        arg2 : str
            Description of arg2

        Returns
        -------
        bool
            Description of return value

        """
        return True

.. note::

    The napoleon extension also supports Google style docstrings, but
    for consistency only the NumPy style should / can be used here!

.. note::

    The docstring needs to have an empty line at the end!

There are more sections that can be included in the docstring like
**Warning**, **Raises**, **Example**, etc. 
(see full list in `sphinx.ext.napoleon`_).

Especially the **Example** section can be quite helpful by showcasing
how the function might be used::

    def func(arg1, arg2):
        """
        ...

        Example
        -------
        Explanation of what is happening.

        >>> from agepy.plot import func
        >>> func(1, "Hello World")
        True

        """

The resulting section will look like this:

**Example**
    
Explanation of what is happening.

>>> from agepy.example import func
>>> func(1, "Hello World")
True

More comprehensive examples can be written in the form of Jupyter
notebooks and added to the tutorials section.


Writing tutorials
-----------------

Tutorials can be written in the form of `Jupyter Notebook`_s in the 
``docs/_notebooks/`` directory.
